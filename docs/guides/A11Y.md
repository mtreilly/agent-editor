# Accessibility Checklist — agent-editor

Use this checklist when adding or changing UI.

## Semantics
- Use semantic regions: `<main>`, `<section>`, headings in order (h1..h3).
- Associate labels with inputs and controls; prefer `<label>` or `aria-label`.

## Keyboard
- Ensure all interactive elements are reachable by Tab and Shift+Tab.
- Widgets support ArrowUp/ArrowDown, Home/End as appropriate.
- Esc closes overlays (e.g., command palette, dialogs) and restores focus.

## ARIA patterns
- Listboxes: role="listbox" on container, role="option" for items, manage `aria-activedescendant`.
- Dialogs/Overlays: role="dialog" or `aria-modal="true"`, initial focus, return focus on close.

## Focus
- Visible focus outline for all controls.
- Manage focus when opening/closing modals and overlays.

## i18n
- Extract all visible text to `public/locales/*/*.json`.
- Avoid concatenating translated strings in ways that break grammar.

## Contrast & touch
- Maintain WCAG AA contrast for text/buttons.
- Touch targets at least 44×44 px; ensure spacing.

## Testing
- Add Playwright assertions with role-based queries (getByRole, getByLabelText).
- Verify keyboard interactions and focus order in E2E flows.
